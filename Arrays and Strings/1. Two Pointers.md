## Two pointers

This is a widespread technique used to solve arrays and string problems. It involves halving two integer variables that both move along an iterable. In this article we are focusing on arrays and stringsÂ 

`i` and `j` or `left` and `right` representing an index of the array or string 

`Start the pointers at the edges of the input, then move them to the middle till they meet` 

```pseudo
function fn(arr):
	left = 0
	right = arr.length - 1

	while left < right: 
		Do some logic here depending on the problem 
		Do some logic here to decide on one of the following 
			1. left++
			2. right-- 
			3. Both left++ and right--
```

The strength of this technique is we will never have more than `O(n)` iterations for the while loop, assuming the work within each iteration is `O(1)` - so linear runtime 


###### Example 1: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise. 

```Java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) { 
	// After reversing a string, the first character becomes the last character.        If a string is the same after being reversed - then true, else false
	int left = 0; 
	int right = s.length() - 1;

	while(left < right) {
		if(s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
			return false;
		}
		left++;
		right--;
	}
	return true;
}
```
**Time complexity: O(n)**
**Space complexity O(1)** 

```md
Given a **sorted** array of unique integers and a target integer, return true if there exists a number that sum to target, false otherwise (similar to TwoSum, but twoSum's input is not sorted) 

: Note the bruteforce approach of pairing every number will result in O(n^2)
```

```Java
public boolean s(int[] x, int sum) {
	int left = 0;
	int right = x.length - 1;

	while(left < right) {
		int curr = x[left] + x[right];
		if(curr == sum) {
			return true;
		}
		if(curr > target) {
			right--;
		}else {
			left++;
		}
	}
	return false;
} 
```
### Another way to use two pointers 
We just saw the approach of using one pointer at the beginning and one at the end. 
What about if the problem has two iterables for the input (like two arrays)
```md
Move along both inputs simultaneously until all elements have been checked. 
```

```md
1. Create two pointers, one for each iterable. Each pointer should start at the first index
2. Use a while loop until one of the pointers reaches the end of its iterable. 
3. At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers forward. This means incrementing either one of the pointers or both of the pointers. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem.
4. Because our while loop will stop when one of the pointers reaches the end, the other pointer will not be at the end of its respective iterable when the loop finishes. IF so, then you will need tow write extra code to do so 
```

```python 
function fn(arr1, arr2):
	i = j = 0
	while i < arr1.length AND j < arr2.length:
		Do some logic depending on the problem
		Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following 
			1. i++
			2. j++
			3. Both i++ and j++
	// Step 4: Make sure both iterables are exhausted
	// Note that only one of these loops would run 
	while i < arr1.length: 
		Do some logic depending on the problem
		i++
	while j < arr2.length:
		Do some logic here depending on the problem 
		j++
```

###### Example 3: Given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array that combines both of them and is also sorted

```Java
// [1, 3, 4, 5]
// [2, 5, 6, 7]
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7]
public List<Integer> combine(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    // ans is the answer
    List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;

    while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            ans.add(arr1[i]);
            i++;
        } else {
            ans.add(arr2[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }

    while (i < arr1.length) {
        ans.add(arr1[i]);
        i++;
    }

    while (j < arr2.length) {
        ans.add(arr2[j]);
        j++;
    }

    return ans;
}
```

###### Example 4: Given two string s and t, return true if s is a sub-sequence of t, or false otherwise 

A subsequence of a string is a sequence of characters that can be obtained by deleting some (or none) of the characters from the original string, while maintaining the relative order of the remaining characters. For example "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not

```Java
public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) { 
	int i = 0;
	int j = 0; 
	int sLen = s.length();
	int tLen = t.length();

	while(i < sLen && j < tLen) { 
		if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
			i++;
		}
		j++;
	}
	return i == sLen;
}
```
