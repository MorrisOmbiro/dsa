Like two pointers, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables with ordered elements.

Implemented using two pointers! 
### Subarrays
Given an array, a subarray is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in the original order. 

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1], [2], [3], [4]
[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]
[1,2,3], [2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]

A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and the end 
for example 
[2, 3] has a starting index of `1` and `2` 
We call the starting index **left bound**
We call the ending index **right bound**
**Another name for subarray is window**

[3, 6, 2, 8, 1,  4, 1, 5] -> [2, 8, 1, 4]
left = 2    right = 5
### When should we use sliding windows
There is a very common group of problems involving subarrays that can be solved effectively with sliding window. 

**First** the problem with either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that makes a subarray "valid". There are 2 components regarding what makes a subarray valid 
1. **A constraint metric.** This is some attribute of a subarray. It could be the sum, the number of unique elements, the frequency of a specific element, or else... 
2. **A numeric restriction on the constraint metric.** This is what the constraint metric should be for a subarray to be considered valid. 
**Second**, the problem will ask you to find valid subarrays in some way. 
1. The most common task you will see is finding the best valid subarray. (	Example: Find the longest valid subarray)
2. Find the number of valid subarrays
