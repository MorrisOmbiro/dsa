Like two pointers, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables with ordered elements.

Implemented using two pointers! 
### Subarrays
Given an array, a subarray is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in the original order. 

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1], [2], [3], [4]
[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]
[1,2,3], [2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]

A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and the end 
for example 
[2, 3] has a starting index of `1` and `2` 
We call the starting index **left bound**
We call the ending index **right bound**
**Another name for subarray is window**

[3, 6, 2, 8, 1,  4, 1, 5] -> [2, 8, 1, 4]
left = 2    right = 5

### When should we use sliding window? 
#### First 
The problem will either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that make a subarray "valid"
1. A constraint metric (some attribute of the subarray, sum, # of unique elements, frequency of a specific element...)
2. A numeric restriction on the constrain metric 

For example, a problem declares a subarray is valid if it has a sum <= 10. The `constraint metric` here is the `sum of the subarray`, the `numeric restriction` is `<= 10`

#### Second
The problem will ask you to find valid subarrays in some way 
1. The most common task you will see is finding the best valid subarray. The problem will define what makes a subarray better than another. For example, a problem might ask you to find the longest valid subarray
2. Another common task is finding the number of valid subarrays

`Whenever a problem description talks about subarrays, you should figure out if sliding window is a good option by analyzing the problem description. If you can find the things mentioned above, then go for it`

* Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`
* Find the longest substring that has at most on `"0"`
* Find the number of subarrays that have a product less than `k`

### The algorithm
Consider only `valid` subarrays. A subarray can be defined by a left bound and a right bound. In sliding window, we maintain `left` and `right` variables representing the current subarray. 
Initially `left = right = 0` (the first subarray we look at is just the first element of the array on its own).
We want to expand the size of our "window" by incrementing `right`
If after adding a new element (incrementing right), our subarray becomes invalid? We need to "remove" some elements from our window until it becomes valid again. To do that, increment `left`, which shrinks our window. 

##### Example
a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`
Find the length of the longest subarray that has a sum less than or equal to `k`
`nums=[3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]`  and `k = 5`
