Prefix sum is a technique that can be used on arrays (of numbers). The idea is to create an array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the sum of all elements up to the index `i` (inclusive). For example
```
nums = [5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 8]
prefix = [5, 7, 8, 14, 17, 25]

When a subarray starts at index "0", it isconsidered a "prefix" of the array. A prefix sum represent the sum of all prefixes.
