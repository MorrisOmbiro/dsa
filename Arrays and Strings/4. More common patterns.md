## O(n) string building
Since strings are immutable - concatenation is an `O(n)` operation. 
Many problems ask you to return a string, and concatenating the string etc. can end up taking `O(n^2)` due to the iterations that it would take to concatenate each string n times. 
There are better ways 
### String builder
When building a string, adding a character to a string is `O(1)` operation. Over `n` operations, that will be `O(n)`
