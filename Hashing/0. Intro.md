This section will cover hash maps and sets - implemented using hashing
A hash function is a function that takes an input and deterministically converts it to an integer that is less than a fixed size set by the programmer.  Inputs are called `keys` and will always map to the same integer. 

Example algorithm of how to make a hash function (not a good one):
1. Declare an integer `total`
2. Iterate over the string, `a -> 1, c -> 3, z-> 26` 
3. Take that value, and multiply it by the current position in the string (index + 1). Add this to `total`. For example, given the string `"abc"` the `b` is at position `2` in the alphabet and position `2` in the string, so it would contribute `2 * 2 = 4` towards `total`. 
4. After going through every character, `total` is the converted value.

### What is the point of a hash function
Basically we want `O(1)` access time! Combining a hash function with an array creates a hash map (hash table or dictionary)

### Some (maybe obvious) things to note 
Hash maps are way better than arrays at
